Welcome to Excelar!

The purpose of this exercise is to see and hear how you solve problems in an existing codebase. This semi-trivial application is composed of a few components and a function call to grab JSON data.

Ask any questions you want, look up anything you want.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

1. Render the list of data located in data/data.json. A hook is provided for you to grab the data and put it into the redux store. We want to display the fields: ["id", "name", "icao", "callsign", "country"].

2. Change the list to render only items with active: "Y".

3. Order the data resulting from step 2 alphabetically (A-Z) on the field "name".

4. (Bonus) Convert the list into a table. Add a header to display the column names at the top.
